<p>When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the
content you staged. This object also contains the authorâ€™s name and email address, the message that
you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent
or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple
parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.</p>
